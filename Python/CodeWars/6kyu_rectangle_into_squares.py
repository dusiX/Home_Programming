# You will be given two dimensions
# a positive integer length
# a positive integer width

# You will return a collection or a string (depending on the language; Shell bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran return a string) with the size of each of the squares.

# Examples in general form:
# (depending on the language)

#   sqInRect(5, 3) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
#   sqInRect(3, 5) should return [3, 2, 1, 1]
  
#   You can see examples for your language in **"SAMPLE TESTS".**
# Notes:
# lng == wdth as a starting case would be an entirely different problem and the drawing is planned to be interpreted with lng != wdth. 

# When the initial parameters are so that lng == wdth, the solution [lng] would be the most obvious but not in the spirit of this kata so, in that case, 
# return None/nil/null/Nothing or return {} with C++, [] with Perl, Raku.

# In that case the returned structure of C will have its sz component equal to 0.

# Return the string "nil" with Bash, PowerShell, Pascal and Fortran.
