This repository contains programs, problem solutions, and projects.

The CodeWars folder includes my solutions to challenges from codewars.com. 
All files in this folder start with a specific kyu number, which indicates the difficulty level of the challenge â€” 8kyu represents the easiest tasks, while 1kyu denotes the most difficult ones. Additionally, each file contains the challenge description as a comment at the beginning.
